- Board specific hardware registers etc.
	System.BB.Board_Support.<BOARDNAME> which resides 
	in RTS file <s-bbsulm.ads> should be updated for each board type.
Update:
    -- MADE EXAMPLE FOR LM3s811 in rts/src/board/lm3s811
    
- Ravenscar context switching must be checked.
	context_switch-bb-arm.s (currently for ARM7TDMI). Verify if changes
	must be made for Cortex-M3.

Update: 
    -- Assembler code changed.
    
- System.BB.CPU.Primitives must be adopted to Cortex-M3 for all board types.
	s-bbcppr.ads and s-bbcppr.adb
	Errors temporary patched.
	arm-none-eabi-gcc ....... ./boards/sf2-starter-kit-050/adainclude/s-bbcppr.adb
	/tmp/ccMaby1m.s: Assembler messages:
	/tmp/ccMaby1m.s:92: Error: selected processor does not support requested special purpose register -- `mrs r3,cpsr'
	/tmp/ccMaby1m.s:105: Error: selected processor does not support requested special purpose register -- `msr cpsr_c,r3'

	/tmp/ccMaby1m.s:147: Error: selected processor does not support requested special purpose register -- `msr cpsr_c,r3'
	make: *** [boards/sf2-starter-kit-050/adalib/s-bbcppr.o] Error 1
	) 
    
Update, changed the assembler code.

- System.BB.Threads have a error message.
	s-bbthre.ads and s-bbthre.adb
	Errors temporary patched.
	Environment_Thread.Top_Of_Stack will be out of bounds during execution. 
	Environment_Thread.Bottom_Of_Stack will be out of bounds during execution. 

 Update, fixed with adding stack bottom, stack top to linked file.
    
- Ada.Synchronous_Task_Control
	a-sytaco.ads and a-sytaco.adb
	Errors temporary patched.
	line 113, 
	a-sytaco.adb:113:08: missing argument for parameter "Mode" in call to "Protected_Single_Entry_Call" declared at s-tposen.ads:219
