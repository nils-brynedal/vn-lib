--  Package in charge of implementing clock and timer functionalities

with System.BB.Parameters;
with System.Multiprocessors;

package System.BB.Time is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   type Time is mod 2 ** 32;
   for Time'Size use 32;
   --  Time is represented at this level as a 64-bit natural number,
   --  representing the number of ticks.

   type Time_Span is range -2 ** 63 .. 2 ** 63 - 1;
   for Time_Span'Size use 64;
   --  Time_Span represents the length of time intervals, and it is defined as
   --  a 64-bit signed integer.

   ---------------
   -- Constants --
   ---------------

   Tick : constant Time := 1;
   --  A clock tick is a real time interval during which the clock value (as
   --  observed by calling the Clock function) remains constant. Tick is the
   --  average length of such intervals.

   Ticks_Per_Second : constant Natural := System.BB.Parameters.Clock_Frequency;
   --  Number of ticks (or clock interrupts) per second

   --------------------
   -- Initialization --
   --------------------

   procedure Initialize_Timers;
   --  Initialize this package (alarm handler). Must be called before any other
   --  functions.

   ----------------
   -- Operations --
   ----------------

   function Clock return Time;
   --  Get the number of ticks elapsed since startup

   procedure Delay_Until (T : Time);
   --  Suspend the calling thread until the absolute time specified by T

   function Get_Next_Timeout (CPU_Id : System.Multiprocessors.CPU) return Time;
   --  Get the date of the next alarm or timing event

   procedure Update_Alarm (Alarm : Time);
   --  Re-configure the timer if "Alarm" is earlier than the Pending_Alarm.
   --  Update_Alarm is the only routine allowed to set an alarm.
